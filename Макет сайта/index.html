      <h1>How the Rise of Soccer in the US Is Changing the Face of Youth Sports</h1>
      <h3>The focus on soccer in youth sports <br>
        programs is exploding nation-wide</h3>
        <hr>
      <p><b>When the first World Cup arrived in the US in the 90's everyone officially declared that soccer was it. Well
          it's taken it's time but we can definitely see the influence of soccer, especially women's soccer, across the
          US. This year, 3 million kids
          played in youth soccer leagues with 2/3 of those leagues for girls. In fact, in the 12-17 age range the MLS
          has
          surpassed the MLB and NFL in popularity.</p>
      <p>Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to the impressively soaring ad dollars being pumped into the
        Women's
        World Cup games in 2014. The women's games generated $40 million for Fox, that's definitely not chump change.
        And
        those advertisers,
        like ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon, Nike, Visa, and other heavy hitters, are working to make sure they see those
        numbers
        grow year after year by investing in youth soccer facilities and promoting programs across the country. </p>
      <p>Now that big business is involved you can be assured you'll see a continued rise in popularity in soccer across
        the country for years to come. </p></b>
